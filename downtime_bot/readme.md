# Pp Bot: Downtime Bot

This folder contains the source code to a seperate Discord bot which is meant to be deployed during downtime.

To run this bot, use the `_run_downtime_bot.sh` script from within the main directory.
If you're feeling funky, do this instead.

```sh
$ cd ./downtime_bot
downtime_bot$ cd ./src
downtime_bot/src$ vbu run-bot . ../../config/config.toml
```
